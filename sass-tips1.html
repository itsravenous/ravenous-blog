<h1>SASS tips - 1: Presentational Semantics: Semantic classes in your markup, presentational classes in your SASS</h1>
<p>If you've used SASS at all, you may be familiar with its wonderful <code>@extend</code> function. If not, here's a quick rundown. <code>@extend</code> takes a leaf from
object-orientated programming and allows you to make a CSS rule 'inherit' all the properties of another. Make sense? So you might write the following:

</p>
<pre class="css">.circle {
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    border-radius: 100px 100px;
}

.sun {
    @extend .circle;

    background: yellow;
}</pre>
<p>Which SASS would compile into regular CSS as follows:

</p>
<pre class="css">.circle,
.sun {
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    border-radius: 100px 100px;
}

.sun {
    background: yellow;
}</pre>
<p>The advantage of using @extend here is that you can look at the ruleset for .sun and instantly tell what it's supposed to achieve - it's a circle, with a yellow background. This is what I mean by <em>presentational semantics</em> - the ability to write class names that represent exactly what they achieve.

<h2>Semantic classes in your markup, presentational classes in your SASS</h2>
<p>So how can we use this to write better HTML and CSS? With the rise of CSS frameworks over the last few years, it's not unusual to see the following
when looking at the source of a web page:

</p>
<pre class="html">&lt;section class="primary eight columns"&gt;
    ...some content
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;aside class="secondary two columns"&gt;
    ...some secondary content
&lt;/aside&gt;</pre>
<p>We all know this is <strong>bad</strong>, but sometimes using a framework is quicker and easier than doing "the right thing", especially when it comes to grids.
Sometimes it feels like designing with tables again, and I'll cover managing grids using SASS to avoid this in another post. So what's the <strong>right</strong> way to do this?
In vanilla CSS, you might write:

</p>
<pre class="css">,primary,
.secondary {
    float: left;
}
.primary {
    width: 80%;
}
.secondary {
    width: 20%;
}</pre>
<p>But when you need to apply grid sizes to a large number of different elements, your CSS file could get messy and unreadable, fast. Instead, with SASS:

</p>
<pre class="css">/* Base grid classes */
.columns {
    float: left;
}
.columns-eight {
    width: 80%;
}
.columns-two {
    width: 20%;
}

/* Main layout */
.primary {
    @extend .columns;
    @extend .columns-eight;
}
.secondary {
    @extend .columns;
    @extend .columns-eight;
}</pre>
<p>And, in fact, we can go one better - <code>@extend</code> supports chaining:

</p>
<pre class="css">/* Base grid classes */
.columns {
    float: left;
}
.columns-eight,
.columns-two {
    @extend .columns;
}
.columns-eight {
    width: 80%;
}
.columns-two {
    width: 20%;
}

/* Main layout */
.primary {
    @extend .columns-eight;
}
.secondary {
    @extend .columns-two;
}</pre>
<p>So <code>.columns-eight</code> and <code>.columns-two</code> inherit the floating behaviour from <code>.columns</code>, and <code>.primary</code> and <code>.secondary</code> inherit that floating behaviour <em>and</em> their width from the <code>.columns-eight</code> and <code>.columns-two</code> classes, respectively. 

</p>
<p>But grids are pretty boring, and you'll probably want to use a library like <a href="http://susy.oddbird.net/">SUSY</a> to handle them, rather than inventing a very complex wheel.
Instead, why not gleefully write all those presentational classes you've secretly wanted to write (and perhaps have written!) over the years:

</p>
<pre class="css">.big-red-box {
    border-radius: 5px;
    border: 2px solid red
    background: #ffee00;
    font-size: 20px;
}

.drop-shadow {
    box-shadow: 0 0 5px #000;
}</pre>
<p>and simply assign them to the elements you like with <code>@extend</code>:

</p>
<pre class="css">.message {
    @extend .big-red-box;
    @extend .drop-shadow;
}</pre>
<p>meaning you avoid this:

</p>
<pre class="html">&lt;div class="message big-red-box drop-shadow"&gt;
    SASS rocks!
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p>and can instead just write this:

</p>
<pre class="html">&lt;div class="message"&gt;
    SASS rocks!
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p>Isn't that awesome? One of my favourite uses of <code>@extend</code> is adding the 'clearfix' hack to elements - no more class="cf" all over my beautiful markup!

</p>
<p>One of the most overlooked implications is the re-skinnability (totally a word) that this approach affords a project. If you've built an app or product
which you want to theme/style completely differently depending on who you're selling it to, you don't have to worry about presentational classes in the markup
getting in the way - you can potentially keep the exact same markup and just change your SASS, and by, a-ha, extension, your CSS. It also makes 'reskins'
of websites twelve months down the line a lot easier!

</p>
<h1>Go forth and <code>@extend</code>!</h1>
<p>Of course, as with all SASS, you could do this with regular CSS, but why would you? SASS means you can structure your CSS in an object-oriented way, which is
great if you're following an OOCSS pattern like Jonathan Snook's <a href="http://smacss.com/">SMACSS</a>. Go ahead and be free to write beautifully semantic markup
without any horrible presentation classes, but keep those <em>presentational semantics</em> visible in your SASS.
